# Product Overview

This is a Mandelbrot set visualizer built with PyQt6 that allows users to input custom mathematical formulas for generating fractal patterns. The application provides an interactive GUI where users can:

- Enter custom z update formulas (e.g., "z * z + c")
- Generate and display Mandelbrot set visualizations in grayscale
- View real-time computation progress with animated status updates
- Explore different fractal patterns through formula experimentation

The project includes sample implementations demonstrating various fractal generation approaches and serves as both a standalone application and a reference for fractal visualization techniques.

## Key Features
- Interactive formula input with real-time validation
- Multi-threaded image generation for responsive UI
- 800x600 pixel grayscale rendering
- Safe mathematical expression evaluation
- Progress indication during computation
